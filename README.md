# fcc-Data-Analysis-with-Python
In this repository, I exhibit my solutions to the projects of the Data Analysis with Python Course by the freeCodeCamp. Unfortunately, I could not claim my certificate of achievement since the real development and testing environment of the projects is terrible and does not even work properly.<br/>If you suspect any violation of any developer please feel free to contact. Below are the official websites for you to review the project tasks and document for each one.
